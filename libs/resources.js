      "SoC is designed to challenge you. There may be times of doubt and uncertainty. But the struggle is part of the challenge. This is an opportunity to do cool things, have experiences, connect with new people.\n \n - Use the support\n - Stay focused\n - Keep moving forward\n - Lean into the experience\n \n You decide whether you think feedback is important\n \n Your ego will mess with you – endeavour to find authentic confidence\n \n When receiving feedback – stay curious\n \n When giving feedback – check your motive\n \n The biggest test of all is to listen proactively to a ‘Jerk’ (though there are fewer than you think!)",

      "There are different types of people in the bootcamp and in the coding industry. You can be the type of person who can join any team and work well with others. \n \n Understand what you bring and how you can help your teammates to bring their best selves. Talk to each other about your style\n \n Remember you are not ‘in a box’ you have your own style\n \n Think about what you bring and also what others might need\n \n You have something you take for granted because it’s ‘you’ – but everybody has a set of incredible gifts",

      "Film producer and innovator Walt Disney used to think-up and refine ideas by breaking the process into three distinct chunks. The dreamer, the realist, and the critic.\n \n The Dreamer - This stage was for fantasizing. Creating the most fantastic and absurd ideas possible. No filter. Just wonderful, raw ideas. This stage was about “why not?”\n \n The Realist - As the Realist, the Dreamer ideas would be re-examined and re-worked into something more practical. It wasn’t about why it could not be achieved, but only about it could be done. This stage is about “how?”\n \n The Critic - In the third stage, he would become the critic… shooting holes in the ideas he had come up with.",

      "We can all be thrown off balance when we are developing. Some of that is biologically wired in. All of that is normal. Self awareness and taking action can help you to recover. You can develop your resilience and reframe your thinking if you actively work on it.\n \n Remember how you react in difficult situations. Have a rant to yourself if you need to, but then have a reality check. Remember your vision and purpose and get some perspective. What can you control and what do you have to let go?\n \n Take one small action at a time.",

Works slowly and methodically, structured and organised. Mortal enemy is context-switching! Want to deep dive. Opposite is Socialiser! \n \n Socialiser – Warm, friendly, positive. Good at influencing people and building alliances. Thrive off other people’s energy. Thrives on recognition! Might do their thinking whilst they are talking. \n \n Relater – thinks things through, can be slow to accept change. Loyal, builds deep relationships. Shares responsibility. \n \n Director – Gets energy from achieving things. Not interested in recognition. Incredibly logical, can be frustrated by others going slower. Up for massive challenges! Likes control/being in charge! \n \n Remember these are just labels and indicators, not absolutes!",

      "A team manifesto is a team-designed agreement for a set of values, behaviours and social norms. It's a vision for the team built on a common set of principles and values. \n \n Psychological safety enables teams to perform well even in uncertain environments, through being able to make mistakes without fear, innovating by trying new and potentially risky endeavours, and through raising concerns or new ideas as they arise.\n \n Also think about conflict resolution within the team. How will you achieve this? Think about dot or Roman voting.",
